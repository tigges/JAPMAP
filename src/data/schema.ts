/**
 * Shared geometry for the JAPMAP land line.
 *
 * Layers stay independent — do not merge into one polyline:
 * - `nhk`        reconstructed Cycle Around Japan episode days (lives on JAPANRIDE)
 * - `network`    official cycle routes (National Cycle Routes, prefectural)
 * - `japanride`  the original traverse that *rides the network* and may
 *                optionally splice NHK episode days as detours
 *
 * Rule: if a segment is a train or a ferry, `kind` says so. Never stroke a
 * train or ferry as `coast`. The honesty is the point.
